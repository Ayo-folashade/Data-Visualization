# About The Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and data analysis. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with each sample having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Iris Dataset Visualizations
This repository contains visualizations of the famous Iris dataset using Python's Seaborn library.

# Scatterplot of Sepal Length versus Sepal Width
The first visualization is a scatterplot of sepal length versus sepal width, colored by species. This plot shows the relationship between these two continuous variables and how they differ between the three species of iris flowers.

# Barplot of Average Petal Length by Species
The second visualization is a barplot of the average petal length by species. This plot shows the differences in petal length between the three species.

# Pie Chart of Relative Frequencies of Species
The third visualization is a pie chart of the relative frequencies of the three species of iris flowers in the dataset.

# Subplots of Boxplots of Sepal Length and Petal Length by Species
The final visualization is a pair of subplots that show boxplots of sepal length and petal length by species. This plot highlights the differences in these variables between the three species.

All of these visualizations were created using Python's Seaborn library and can be reproduced using the code in the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository.

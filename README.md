# Data Visualization
This repository contains data visualization of the famous Iris dataset using the Seaborn library.
The Iris dataset is being used, and it consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

- The first visualization is a scatterplot of sepal length versus sepal width, colored by species. This plot shows the relationship between these two continuous variables and how they differ between the three species of iris flowers.

- The second visualization is a barplot of the average petal length by species. This plot shows the differences in petal length between the three species.

- The third visualization is a pie chart of the relative frequencies of the three species of iris flowers in the dataset.

- The final visualization is a pair of subplots that show boxplots of sepal length and petal length by species. This plot highlights the differences in these variables between the three species.
